Notes: 
- Pushed venv's except for Week 5, where the venv was too large due to tensorflow
- Hence added r.txt for W5, but there is are lots of packages inside not really neded; Just install manually
- Freezing with pip created .txt files with too much crap from system wide installations 
- (Potentially they are also in the venv â€“ swap venv's for r.txt's once new computer!)
